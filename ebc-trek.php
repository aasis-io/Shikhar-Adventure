                    <p>This world-famous trek brings you within eyeshot of the world’s highest mountain – Mt. Everest (8848m). The Everest Base Camp Trek lies within Sagarmatha National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre, and the world’s highest national park – full of rare flora and fauna that can’t be found anywhere else in the world. Our Everest Base Camp Trek is a challenging journey high into the Himalayas that offers rewarding views for those who reach the top.</p>

                    <p>After a short, scenic flight to Lukla, we begin our trek full of excitement. The following day, after passing through Sherpa villages and their fields, we reach Namche Bazaar – a trekking and trading hub of the region where we can spend time with the kindhearted Sherpa ethnic group. We pass several Tibetan Buddhist monasteries – Tengboche Monastery being the largest and most well-known. From here, the incredible alpine landscape fills us with energy.</p>

                    <p>Upon arriving at Everest Base Camp (5364m), we instantly see the pristine beauty of this alpine region. Everest Base Camp Trek is an opportunity to see massive Himalayan peaks taller than 8000 meters - Mt. Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and several others. The views of the deadly Khumbu Icefall and surrounding glaciers are incredible. Next, we visit Kala Patthar (5540m), which gives us a panoramic view of high peaks, as well as the Khumbu Glacial Valley. Feeling rejuvenated, we descend back to Namche Bazaar and eventually fly back to Kathmandu from Lukla.</p>

                    <p>Trekking is possible throughout the year, but Spring (March to May) and Autumn (September to November) provide the best weather. During the Spring, there is a bit more color and the rhododendrons are blooming, and in the Autumn months, the skies are generally clearer. The Everest Base Camp Trek requires fitness and acclimatization to avoid acute mountain sickness. Shikhar Adventure arranges the trek with complete management. Please, feel free to contact us for more detailed information.</p>
